dots
====

This is the master repo for my dotfiles. It includes my forks of oh-my-zsh
(for shell) and spf13 (for Vim) as submodules.

I pretty much just use a Mac all the time, and these files reflect that, but
I'd like to spend a little effort getting everything solid on Linux as well.

Installation
------------

I've tried to make this as simple and smooth as possible, but please, be
careful; make sure you understand what this code will do before you run it.

Basically, just run this script in your shell and you should be good to go:

    sh <(curl https://raw.github.com/smt/dots/master/install.sh -L)

You can instead clone this repo and run `install.sh` manually, if you choose.

Credit
------

Obviously, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and
[spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) have my gratitude.

[James Tomasino](https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles)'s dotfiles were a huge
source of inspiration. You really should check his out.

[Abraham Walters](https://github.com/quidmonkey/dotfiles) has been quick to
show me some new tricks as well.
